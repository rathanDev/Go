# Unbuffered Channel vs Buffered Channel in Go

In Go, channels are used for communication between goroutines. 
They can be either unbuffered or buffered, and each has its own behavior.

#1. Unbuffered Channel

- Definition: An unbuffered channel has no internal storage. It blocks the sending goroutine until another goroutine is ready to receive the value.
- Behavior: 
  - A send operation (`ch <- value`) will block until another goroutine performs a receive operation (`value := <-ch`).
  - A receive operation will block until there is data to receive from the channel.

- Use Cases:
  - Useful when you want goroutines to synchronize and communicate at a specific point in time.
  - Ensures that each message is received immediately after being sent.

- Example:
  ```go
  ch := make(chan string) // Unbuffered channel

  // Send blocks until the receiver is ready.
  go func() {
    ch <- "Hello" // Blocks here until getHello receives.
  }()

  // Receive blocks until the sender sends.
  msg := <-ch // Blocks until the sender sends "Hello"
  fmt.Println(msg)
  ```

  - Blocking Behavior: If there are multiple sends and receives, each send will block until it is matched by a corresponding receive.

#2. Buffered Channel

- Definition: A buffered channel has a fixed size buffer that stores values temporarily. It doesn't block the sender until the buffer is full.
- Behavior:
  - The sender will block only when the buffer is full.
  - The receiver will block only when the buffer is empty.
  - A buffered channel allows you to send multiple values without waiting for the receiver, as long as there is space in the buffer.

- Use Cases:
  - Useful when you want to send values asynchronously or when you want to decouple the senders and receivers.
  - Allows for temporary "storage" of messages.
  - Useful in situations where you expect high throughput or need to decouple sender/receiver speeds.

- Example:
  ```go
  ch := make(chan string, 2) // Buffered channel with a capacity of 2

  // Send does not block immediately
  ch <- "Hello"   // Does not block because there's space in the buffer
  ch <- "World"   // Does not block because there's space in the buffer

  // Receive blocks until there's data in the channel
  fmt.Println(<-ch) // Prints "Hello"
  fmt.Println(<-ch) // Prints "World"
  ```

  - Non-blocking Behavior: The sender can continue sending until the buffer is full, without blocking.

Key Differences:

| Feature                         | Unbuffered Channel                               | Buffered Channel                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Buffer Size                  | Zero capacity (no internal buffer)               | Can have a specified buffer size                 |
| Send Block                   | Blocks until a receiver is ready                | Blocks only if the buffer is full                |
| Receive Block                | Blocks until a sender sends data                | Blocks only if the buffer is empty               |
| Synchronization              | Synchronizes senders and receivers immediately   | Allows asynchronous communication (when the buffer has space) |
| Use Case                     | Useful for tight synchronization between goroutines | Useful for decoupling sender and receiver, allowing independent speeds |
| Example                      | `ch <- "data"; val := <-ch`                     | `ch <- "data"; val := <-ch` (send does not block until buffer is full) |

When to Use Each?

- Use an Unbuffered Channel:
  - When you need synchronization between sender and receiver (i.e., you want the sender and receiver to match up perfectly).
  - Example: A worker pool where each worker sends a result immediately after completing a task.
  
- Use a Buffered Channel:
  - When you want to decouple sender and receiver operations.
  - Example: A producer-consumer scenario, where producers can produce at a faster rate than consumers can consume, and the buffered channel stores intermediate values until the consumer is ready.

Example Comparison:

#Unbuffered Channel (Synchronization):
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Sending message")
        ch <- "Hello" // Blocks until someone is ready to receive
    }()

    fmt.Println(<-ch) // Blocks until a message is received
}
```

#Buffered Channel (Asynchronous):
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string, 2) // Buffered channel with space for 2 messages

    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Sending message")
        ch <- "Hello" // Does not block, as there is space in the buffer
    }()

    fmt.Println(<-ch) // Receive the message
}
```
