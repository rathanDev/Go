## 1. Event Sourcing  
Definition  
Event Sourcing is a design pattern where state changes in an application are stored as a sequence of events rather than just storing the current state in a database.  

How It Works
- Instead of updating a database record directly, an application records events describing what happened.  
- To get the current state, the system replays the events in order.  

Example (Bank Transactions)  
Instead of storing a balance as `1000`, an event-sourced system would store:  
1. `Deposited $500`
2. `Deposited $500`
3. `Withdrew $100`  

The balance is derived by replaying these events: 500 + 500 - 100 = 900.  

Benefits
‚úÖ Full history of changes (audit log)  
‚úÖ Easier debugging and rollback  
‚úÖ Enables event-driven architectures  

Challenges
‚ùå Requires event storage (e.g., Kafka, EventStoreDB)  
‚ùå Replaying events can be slow if there are too many

## 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)  
Definition  
DDD is a software design approach that focuses on modeling software based on real-world business domains.  

Key Concepts
- Entities: Objects with unique identity (e.g., `User`, `Order`).  
- Value Objects: Objects without identity (e.g., `Money`, `Address`).  
- Aggregates: Groups of related objects treated as a single unit (e.g., `Order` and its `OrderItems`).  
- Repositories: Abstractions for database interactions.  
- Domain Events: Events that describe business actions (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `PaymentProcessed`).  

Example (E-commerce Order System)
Instead of working directly with database tables, we define real-world concepts in code:  
```go
type Order struct {
    ID          string
    Items       []OrderItem
    Status      string
}

func (o *Order) PlaceOrder() {
    o.Status = "Placed"
    // Publish domain event OrderPlaced
}
```
Benefits
‚úÖ Closer to business logic  
‚úÖ Clear boundaries between different parts of the system  

Challenges
‚ùå Can be complex for small projects  
‚ùå Requires a deep understanding of the business

## 3. Concurrency in NoSQL Databases  
Why is Concurrency Important?
- Multiple users/processes can read/write the same data at the same time.
- NoSQL databases don‚Äôt always use transactions like SQL, so handling concurrency properly is critical.  

How NoSQL Handles Concurrency
1. Optimistic Locking  
   - The document has a version number (or timestamp).
   - When updating, the system checks if the version matches.
   - If another update happened, it rejects the change.  
   - Used in Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB.  

2. Pessimistic Locking  
   - A process locks a document so no one else can modify it.
   - Used in some cases for MongoDB with `$isolated` operations.  

3. Eventual Consistency  
   - In distributed NoSQL databases, data might not be updated immediately everywhere.
   - Different nodes eventually sync the latest data.
   - Used in DynamoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase.

## 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)  
Definition  
CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates:  
- Commands (write operations) from  
- Queries (read operations).  

How It Works
- Instead of a single database for both reading and writing, we use:  
  - Write model (handles inserts/updates/deletes)  
  - Read model (optimized for fast queries)  

Example (E-commerce Order System)  
- When placing an order, it goes to the write model (`orders_db`).  
- When viewing order history, it pulls from a read-optimized DB (`orders_read_db`).  

This is often used with Event Sourcing because events are stored in the write model, and the read model is updated asynchronously.  

Benefits
‚úÖ Optimized read performance  
‚úÖ Can scale read & write models independently  
‚úÖ Works well with microservices  

Challenges
‚ùå More complex (syncing read and write models)  
‚ùå Requires event processing

## Conclusion  
- Event Sourcing ‚Üí Store changes as events instead of just saving the current state.  
- DDD ‚Üí Model software based on real-world business concepts.  
- NoSQL Concurrency ‚Üí Manage concurrent writes using Optimistic Locking, Pessimistic Locking, or Eventual Consistency.  
- CQRS ‚Üí Separate read and write operations for better scalability.
